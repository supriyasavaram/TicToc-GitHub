    <string name="support">Thank you for supporting us and our year-long student research project we worked so hard on.
        \n\nWe couldn\'t have done it without the continuous encouragement from our lab directors, Mr. Kosek and Ms. Galanos, and from our school, TJHSST.
        \n\nFinally, we couldn\'t have done it without you!\n\nSo, thank you, and we hope you enjoy our app! </string>
